# FabLab
## Intro
In this repository you'll find a collection of tools and software that can be used in Maker spaces and FabLabs.

The focus is mainly on open source and free software that is Linux compatible.

This is a work under progress. Feel free to add your suggestions.

[TOC]

## CAD Tools
Tools you could use to make your digital designs with.
Also tools to design PCB's with are added in this list.

[Go to the list](CAD-tools.md)

## Generators
When you don't have the time or expertise to draw something your self you can use a generator to generate an enclosure or a set of gears.

[Go to list](Generators.md)

## Nesting software
Combine multiple designs nested tightly together.

[Go to list](Nesting-tools.md)

## CNC CAM Tools
This tools can be used to go from a digital design to toolpaths, GCODE, NC files to control your CNC machine.

[Go to list](CAM-tools-CNC.md)

## 3D printer CAM Tools / slicers
This tools can be used to go from a digital design to toolpaths, GCODE, NC files to control your CNC machine.

[Go to list](CAM-tools-3D.md)


## G-CODE simulators
Before you send your machine code you might want to check for errors. You can do this with a simulator.

[Go to list](gcode-simulators.md)


## CNC Controllers.
This tools can be used to control your CNC machine set your origin, calibrate your machine, send G-Code..
